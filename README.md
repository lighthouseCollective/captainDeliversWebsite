### Structure of the Site
This single-page website is designed to quickly educate viewers about Captain Delivers, and encourage them to utilize the service. At any time, the viewer can return to the top of the page by clicking the logo in the top left of the screen, on the navBar. The user can also click the "Contact us" button on the right side of the navBar to be quickly pushed to the contactForm. Because the navBar follows the user down the page, it is very easy and quick to navigate to the varying sections of the site.
